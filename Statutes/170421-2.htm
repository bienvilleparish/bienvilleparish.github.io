<p class="PdfParaStyle03">PART I. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle03">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle04" style="margin-left: 75px; text-indent: -75px;">17:421.2 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cost-of-living increases based on annually adjusted increases in Consumer Price Index</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;A. In order to maintain the purchasing power of the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules now or hereafter established by law for teachers, but drivers, and other public school employees, including employees of all state supported vocational and technical schools, at constant levels without the necessity of frequent amendments to such minimum salaries or salary schedules, it is declared to be the policy of the state to maintain without reduction any base dollar amounts established in such minimum salaries and salary schedules and to provide in addition thereto annual salary adjustments based on increases or decreases in the cost of living as reflected in the official Consumer Price Index as published by the government of the United States.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;B. Beginning with the 1973-74 school session, the legislature of Louisiana shall provide sufficient funds to implement fully the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules for teachers provided in R.S. 17:421, the statewide minimum salaries for school employees as provided in R.S. 17:422.1, the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules for school bus drivers provided in R.S. 17:496, and the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules for any other employees of the public schools whose salaries are regulated by law, including employees of all state supported vocational and technical schools, and, in addition, such additional funds shall be appropriated annually as may be necessary to guarantee a cost-of-living salary increase over and above the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules provided by law. The cost-of-living salary increases shall be based and computed on the statewide minimum salaries and salary schedules established by law and shall be adjusted annually in accordance with increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index over the preceding calendar year period ending December 31. By January 31, 1973 and each succeeding year, or as soon after January 31 as official statistics shall be available, the Louisiana State Board of Education shall certify to the governor the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index increased or decreased during the immediately preceding calendar year ending December 31. The amount of any percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index shall be added to, and the amount of any percentage decrease in the index shall be subtracted from, the percentage by which any cost-of-living increases in effect during the current school session exceeded the base minimum salaries and salary schedules established by law for teachers, school bus drivers, and other public school employees, including employees of all state supported vocational and technical schools, in order to ascertain the amount of the cost-of-living increases, if any, to be paid during the next school session; provided, however, that in no event shall any statewide minimum salary or salary schedule established by law for such teachers, school bus drivers, and other public school employees, including employees of all state supported vocational and technical schools, be reduced below the scheduled dollar amounts paid under full implementation of such minimum salaries and salary schedules in the school session 1971-72. Dollar amounts of cost-of-living increases may be rounded to the nearest dollar.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics shall be utilized for the purposes of this section, and the index shall be based on or converted to the base year 1967 in determining the increases or decreases in consumer prices from one calendar year to another.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;The cost-of-living salary increases or adjustments made under this section shall not have the effect of reducing or replacing any supplementary salary amount or benefit paid by parish and city school boards from other sources.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;C. If the amounts appropriated by the legislature are insufficient to pay in full the cost-of-living salary increases provided for in this section, such cost-of-living increases shall be reduced proportionately; provided, however, that in no event shall any statewide minimum salary or salary schedule established by law for teachers, school bus drivers, other public school employees, including employees of all state-supported vocational and technical schools, and all employees in the school lunch program operated by the School Food Services' Program administered by the state department of education, be reduced below the scheduled dollar amounts paid under full implementation of such minimum salaries and salary schedules in the school session 1971-72 in any year, month, or portion of a month during which such teachers, school bus drivers, other public school employees, and all employees in the school lunch program operated by the school food services' program administered by the state department of education, are required to perform their duties.</p>
