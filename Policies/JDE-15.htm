<p class="Title">EXPULSION</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board may expel a pupil from school if an 
 offense committed by the pupil is serious enough to warrant such action 
 or is in violation of state law.&#160;&#160;Upon the recommendation for 
 expulsion of a pupil by the principal, the Superintendent or his/her designee 
 shall conduct a hearing to determine the facts of the case and make a 
 finding of whether or not the student is guilty of conduct warranting 
 a recommendation of expulsion. &#160;Notification of the time, date, and 
 place of the expulsion hearing shall be mailed to the parents.&#160;&#160;Following 
 the hearing, the Superintendent or his/her designee shall notify the parents 
 of the decision rendered.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the hearing, the principal and/or teacher concerned may be represented 
 by any person appointed by the Superintendent and the concerned teacher 
 shall be permitted to attend and present any relevant information.&#160;&#160;Until 
 the hearing, the pupil shall remain suspended.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon the conclusion of the hearing and upon finding the student guilty 
 of conduct warranting expulsion, the Superintendent shall determine whether 
 such student shall be expelled and the specified period of expulsion, 
 or if other disciplinary action shall be taken.&#160;&#160;Unless otherwise 
 stipulated by state statutes, the period of expulsion shall not be less 
 than one school semester and may carry over into the next school year, 
 if necessary. &#160;During an expulsion, the Superintendent shall place 
 the student in an alternative school or in an alternative educational 
 placement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The parent or tutor of the pupil may, within five (5) days after the 
 decision to expel has been rendered, request the School Board to review 
 the findings of the Superintendent or designee at a time set by the School 
 Board.&#160;&#160;After reviewing the findings of the Superintendent or 
 designee, the School Board may affirm, modify, or reverse the action of 
 the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any pupil who is expelled shall receive no credit for school work missed 
 while he/she is expelled.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EXPULSION INVOLVING FIREARMS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student, age sixteen (16) or older, or under sixteen (16) and in 
 grades six (6) through twelve (12), who is found guilty of being in possession 
 of a firearm on school property, on a school bus or in actual possession 
 at a school-sponsored event, pursuant to a hearing, shall be expelled 
 from school for a minimum period of four (4) complete school semesters 
 and shall be referred to the district attorney for appropriate action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student in kindergarten through grade five (5) who is found guilty 
 of being in possession of a firearm on school property, on a school bus, 
 or in actual possession at a school-sponsored event, pursuant to a hearing, 
 shall be expelled from school for a minimum period of two (2) complete 
 school semesters and shall be referred to the district attorney for appropriate 
 action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent, however, may modify the length of the minimum expulsion 
 required in the above paragraphs on a case-by-case basis, provided such 
 modification is in writing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EXPULSION INVOLVING DRUGS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student, sixteen (16) years of age or older, found guilty of possession 
 of, or knowledge of and intentional distribution of or possession with 
 intent to distribute any illegal narcotic, drug, or other controlled substance 
 on school property, on a school bus or at a school-sponsored event, pursuant 
 to a hearing, shall be expelled from school for a minimum period of four 
 (4) complete school semesters.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student who is under sixteen (16) years of age and in grades six 
 (6) through twelve (12) and who is found guilty of possession of, or knowledge 
 of and intentional distribution of or possession with intent to distribute

 on a school bus, or at a school-sponsored event pursuant to a hearing 
 shall be expelled from school for a minimum period of two (2) complete 
 school semesters.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

 at a school-sponsored event, pursuant to a hearing, shall be referred 
 to the School Board through a recommendation for action from the Superintendent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.5in;">&#160;</p>
<p><u>ADDITIONAL REASONS FOR EXPULSION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Pupils may also be expelled for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Any pupil, after being suspended for committing violations of 
	 any discipline policies or other rule infractions, depending on the 
	 severity of the behavior, may be expelled upon recommendation to the 
	 Superintendent by the principal and after an appropriate hearing is 
	 held by the Superintendent or designee.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Any student who is found carrying or possessing a knife with 
	 a blade which equals or exceeds two (2) inches in length.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>In accordance with federal regulations, a pupil determined to 
	 have brought a weapon to a school under the School Board's jurisdiction 
	 shall be expelled for a minimum of one calendar year.&#160;&#160;The 
	 Superintendent may modify the expulsion requirement on a case-by-case 
	 basis.&#160;&#160;A <i>weapon</i>, in accordance with federal statutes, 
	 means a firearm or any device which is designed to expel a projectile 
	 or any destructive device, which in turn means any explosive, incendiary 
	 or poison gas, bomb, grenade, rocket, missile, mine or similar device.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Any student, <i>after being suspended on three (3) occasions</i> 
	 for committing offenses involving a firearm, knife or other dangerous 
	 instrumentality, or drugs, narcotics or other controlled dangerous 
	 substances during the same school year, <b>shall</b>, <i>upon committing 
	 the fourth offense</i>, be expelled from all the public schools of 
	 the system until the beginning of the next regular school year, and 
	 the pupil's reinstatement shall be subject to the review and approval 
	 of the School Board.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The conviction of any pupil of a felony or the incarceration 
	 of any pupil in a juvenile institution for an act which had it been 
	 committed by an adult, would have constituted a felony, may be cause 
	 for expulsion of the pupil for a period of time as determined by the 
	 School Board; such expulsions shall require the vote of <b><i>two-thirds</i></b> 
	 <b><i>of the elected members of the School Board</i></b>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EXPULSION NOT APPLICABLE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Expulsion shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>A student carrying or possessing a firearm or knife for purposes 
	 of involvement in a school class, course, or school approved co-curricular 
	 or extracurricular activity or any other activity approved by appropriate 
	 school officials.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>A student possessing any controlled dangerous substance that 
	 has been obtained directly or due to a valid prescription or order 
	 from a licensed physician.&#160;&#160;However, such student shall 
	 carry evidence of that prescription or physician's order on his/her 
	 person at all times when in possession of any controlled dangerous 
	 substance which shall be subject to verification.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, school officials, in accordance with statutory provisions, 
 shall have total discretion and shall exercise such discretion in imposing 
 on a pupil any disciplinary actions authorized by state law for possession 
 by a pupil of a firearm or knife on school property when such firearm 
 or knife is stored in a motor vehicle and there is no evidence of the 
 pupil's intent to use the firearm or knife in a criminal manner.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student enrolled in grades prekindergarten through five shall not 
 be expelled from school for a uniform violation that is not tied to willful 
 disregard of school policies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>READMITTANCE FOLLOWING EXPULSION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Required Parent Conference</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In each case of expulsion, the school principal, or his or her designee, 
 shall contact the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of the pupil to notify 
 them of the expulsion, and establish a date and time for a conference 
 with the principal or designee as a requirement for readmitting the pupil.&#160;&#160;Notice 
 shall be given by sending a certified letter to the address shown on the 
 pupil's registration card.&#160;&#160;Also, additional notification may 
 be made by contacting the parent, tutor, or legal guardian by telephone 
 at the telephone number shown on the pupil's registration card.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the parent, tutor, or legal guardian fails to attend the required 
 conference within five (5) school days of notification, the student may 
 be considered a truant and dealt with according to all applicable statutory 
 provisions.&#160;&#160;On not more than one occasion each school year 
 when the parents, tutor, or legal guardian refuses to respond, the principal 
 may determine whether readmitting the pupil is in the best interest of 
 the pupil.&#160;&#160;On any subsequent occasions in the same school year, 
 the pupil shall not be readmitted unless the parent, tutor, or legal guardian, 
 court, or other appointed representative responds.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In any case where a teacher, principal, or other school employee is 
 authorized to require the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of a pupil 
 to attend a conference or meeting regarding the pupil's behavior and after 
 notice, the parent, tutor, or legal guardian willfully refuses to attend, 
 the principal or his or her designee shall file a complaint, in accordance 
 with statutory provisions, with a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Readmittance After All Expulsions</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any pupil expelled may be readmitted to school on a probationary basis 
 at any time during the expulsion period on such terms and conditions as 
 may be stipulated by the School Board.&#160;&#160;Readmission to school 
 on a probationary basis shall be contingent on the pupil and legal guardian 
 or custodian agreeing in writing to the conditions stipulated. &#160;Any 
 such agreement shall contain a provision for immediate removal of the 
 pupil from school premises without benefit of a hearing or other procedure 
 upon the principal or Superintendent determining the pupil has violated 
 any term or condition of the agreement.&#160;&#160;Immediately thereafter, 
 the principal or designee shall provide proper notification in writing 
 of the determination and reasons for removal to the Superintendent and 
 the pupil's parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Readmittance After Expulsion for Firearms, Knives, Weapons, or Drugs</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to the readmittance provisions for all expulsions stated 
 above, a pupil that has been expelled for possessing on school property 
 or on a bus, a firearm, knife, or other dangerous weapon, or possessing 
 or possession with intent to distribute or distributing, selling, giving, 
 or loaning while on school property or a school bus any controlled dangerous 
 substance shall not be enrolled or readmitted to any such school on a 
 probationary basis prior to the completion of the period of expulsion 
 until the pupil produces written documentation that he/she and his/her 
 parent or legal guardian have enrolled and participated or is participating 
 in an appropriate rehabilitation or counseling program related to the 
 reason(s) for the pupil’s expulsion. &#160;The rehabilitation or counseling 
 programs shall be provided by such programs approved by the juvenile or 
 family court having jurisdiction, if applicable, or by the School Board.&#160;&#160;The 
 requirement for enrollment and participation in a rehabilitation or counseling 
 program shall be waived only upon a documented showing by the pupil that 
 no appropriate program is available in the area or that the pupil cannot 
 enroll or participate due to financial hardship.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Review of Records</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A pupil who has been expelled from any school in or out of state shall 
 not be admitted to a school in the school system except upon the review 
 and approval of the School Board following the request for admission.&#160;&#160;To 
 facilitate the review and approval for readmittance, the pupil shall provide 
 to the School Board information on the dates of any expulsions and the 
 reasons therefor.&#160;&#160;Additionally, the transfer of pupil records 
 to any school or system shall include information on the dates of any 
 expulsions and the reasons therefor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RECUSAL OF ADMINISTRATOR IN DISCIPLINE MATTERS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any school administrator or administrator's designee who is required 
 to make a recommendation, decide an issue, or take action in a matter 
 involving the discipline of a student shall recuse himself/herself whenever 
 a member of the immediate family of the administrator or administrator's 
 designee is involved in any manner in the discipline matter.&#160;&#160;In 
 case of recusal, the action to be taken shall be done so by the Superintendent 
 or an impartial designee of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Immediate family</i> means the individual's children, brothers, sisters, 
 parents, and spouse and the children, brothers, sisters, and parents of 
 the spouse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EXPULSION OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Expulsion of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with 
 applicable state or federal law and regulations.</p>
