<p class="Title">PARENT CONFERENCES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board realizes that close communication between home and school is an important factor in establishing a highly effective school program.&#160;&#160;Planned conferences between parents and teachers are an important way to bring about understanding and close cooperation between the home and school.&#160;&#160;Close communication should be maintained through conferences with all parents, not just with those where academic or other problems suggest the need for closer communication.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ACADEMIC CONFERENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At least two (2) parent-teacher conferences shall be scheduled by teachers during the first semester of each school year.&#160;&#160;At least one (1) parent or legal guardian of the child shall attend or participate in at least one (1) of the scheduled parent-teacher conferences.&#160;&#160;A teacher need not require a parent or legal guardian to attend a conference if the conference would be unnecessary due to the student’s academic record.&#160;&#160;Other conferences may be scheduled as the need arises.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a middle school or high school student has more than one teacher, the parent or legal guardian may participate in the conference by conference call.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall direct the Superintendent to establish regulations regarding the failure of the parent or legal guardian to attend at least one (1) of the scheduled parent-teacher conferences.&#160;&#160;Said regulations shall not include any negative action against the student as a result of the parents/legal guardians not attending the required parent-teacher conference.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal or supervisor should be present at any parent-teacher conference when there is reason to anticipate an atmosphere of hostility.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a student’s academic performance is such that it could threaten the student's ability to be promoted to the next grade level, the student’s parent/legal guardian shall be offered an in-person meeting with the child's classroom teacher and school leader to discuss any resources or strategies available to support and encourage the student's academic improvement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DISCIPLINARY CONFERENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Parents may be required to attend a conference with their student's teacher/ principal/school counselor under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>When a student is removed from a classroom by the teacher, the teacher or the principal or his/her designee may require that the parent or legal guardian of the student have a conference with the teacher or the principal or his/her designee. &#160;Such conference may be in person or by telephone or other virtual means.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the <i>third</i> removal from the same classroom during the school year, a conference between the teacher or other appropriate school employee and the student’s parent or legal guardian may be required prior to the student being readmitted to the classroom.&#160;&#160;Such conference may be in person or by telephone or other virtual means.&#160;&#160;If such conferences is required by the school, the school shall give written notice to the parent.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case where a teacher, principal, or other school employee requires the parent or legal guardian of a student under eighteen (18) to attend a conference or meeting regarding the student's behavior, and, after notice, the parent or legal guardian willfully refuses to attend, the principal or designee shall file a complaint with a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In each case of out-of-school suspension, assignment to alternative placement, or expulsion of a student, a conference shall be scheduled with the student's parent<s>,</s> or legal guardian and the principal or his/her designee, as a requirement for readmitting the student to school.&#160;&#160;Notification of the conference shall be by telephone, electronic communication, or in certain cases, including the case of expulsion, by certified letter.&#160;&#160;Such conference shall be held within five (5) school days of mailing the certified letter or other contact. If the parent or legal guardian fails to attend the required conference within five (5) school days of mailing the certified letter or other contact with the parent, the truancy laws shall become effective.<br />
<br />
On not more than one occasion each school year when the parent or legal guardian refuses to respond, the principal may determine whether readmitting the student is in the best interest of the student.&#160;&#160;On any subsequent occasions in the same school year, the student shall not be readmitted unless the parent, legal guardian, court, or other appointed representative responds.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a student is suspended a second time within one school year, the principal may require that a counseling session be held with the parent, student, and the school counselor if a counselor is assigned or available to that school.&#160;&#160;If no school counselor is assigned at that school, the principal may require a conference between the parent, student and all the student's teachers and the principal or other administrator.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before a student’s <i>third</i> unexcused absence or unexcused occurrence of being tardy, the principal or his/her designee shall notify the parent or legal guardian in writing and shall hold a conference with the parent or legal guardian.&#160;&#160;This notification shall include information relative to the parent or legal guardian's legal responsibility to enforce the student's attendance at school and the civil penalties that may be incurred if the student is determined to be habitually absent or habitually tardy. &#160;The parent or legal guardian shall sign a receipt acknowledging notification.&#160;&#160;<i>Tardy</i>, for the purposes of this enumerated item, shall be as defined in La.

Ann. §<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a21" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) &gt;= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/170233.htm');return false;" name="a21">17:233</a>.</p>
