<p class="Title">SCHOOL WELLNESS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Bienville Parish School Board (hereto referred to as the District) is committed to the optimal development of every student. &#160;The School District believes that for students to have the opportunity to achieve personal, academic, developmental and social success, we need to create positive, safe and health-promoting learning environments at every level, in every setting, throughout the school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This policy outlines the School District’s approach to ensuring environments and opportunities for all students to practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors throughout the school day while minimizing commercial distractions.&#160;&#160;Specifically, this policy establishes goals and procedures to ensure that:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>Students in the School District have access to healthy foods throughout the school day ‒ both through reimbursable school meals and other foods available throughout the school campus‒ in accordance with Federal and state nutrition standards;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students receive quality nutrition education that helps them develop lifelong healthy eating behaviors;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students have opportunities to be physically active before, during and after school;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SCHOOL WELLNESS COMMITTEE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Committee Role and Membership</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will convene a representative district wellness committee (hereto referred to as the DWC or work within an existing school health committee) to establish goals for and oversee school health and safety policies and programs, including development, implementation and periodic review and update of this district-level wellness policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Leadership</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee(s) will convene the DWC and facilitate development of and updates to the wellness policy, and will ensure each school’s compliance with the policy.&#160;&#160;In each school, the principal or designee shall oversee compliance with those policies in his/her school and shall report on the school’s compliance to the Superintendent of his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Child Nutrition Program staff, and the school or district level, shall assess compliance with nutrition policies within school food services areas and report this matter to the Superintendent (or to the principal at the school level).</p>

<p><u>WELLNESS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Implementation Plan</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Recordkeeping</u></i></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Triennial Progress Assessments</u></i></p>

<p style="margin-left: .85pt;">The School District is committed to providing a school environment that ensures opportunities for all students to practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors throughout the school day while minimizing commercial distractions. &#160;The School District strives to teach students how to make informed choices about nutrition, health and physical activity. These efforts will be weakened if students are subjected to advertising on School District property that contains messages inconsistent with the health information the School District is imparting through nutrition education and health promotion efforts. It is the intent of the School District to protect and promote student’s health by permitting advertising and marketing for only those foods and beverages that are permitted to be sold on the school campus, consistent with the School District’s wellness policy.</p>

<p>All elementary schools will offer at least 20 minutes of recess on all days during the school year.&#160;&#160;This policy may be waived on early dismissal or late arrival days. &#160;If recess is offered before lunch, schools will have appropriate hand-washing facilities and/or hand-sanitizing mechanisms located just inside/outside the cafeteria to ensure proper hygiene prior to eating and students are required to use these mechanisms before eating. &#160;Hand-washing time, as well as time to put away coats/hats/gloves, will be built in to the recess transition period/timeframe before students enter the cafeteria.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Outdoor recess will be offered when weather is feasible for outdoor play.&#160;&#160;In the event that the school or district must conduct indoor recess, teachers and staff will follow the indoor recess guidelines that promote physical activity for students, to the extent practicable. &#160;Recess will complement, not substitute, physical education class. &#160;Recess monitors or teachers will encourage students to be active, and will serve as role models by being physically active alongside the students whenever feasible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Classroom Physical Activity Breaks (Elementary and Secondary)</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District recognizes that students are more attentive and ready to learn if provided with periodic breaks when they can be physically active or stretch. &#160;Thus, students will be offered periodic opportunities to be active or to stretch throughout the day on all or most days during a typical school week. &#160;The School District recommends teachers provide short (3-5-minute) physical activity breaks to students during and between classroom time at least three days per week. &#160;These physical activity breaks will complement, not substitute, for physical education class, recess, and class transition periods.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will provide resources and links to resources, tools, and technology with ideas for classroom physical activity breaks. &#160;Resources and ideas are available through USDA and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Active Academics</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers will incorporate movement and kinesthetic learning approaches into “core” subject instruction when possible (e.g., science, math, language arts, social studies and others) and do their part to limit sedentary behavior during the school day.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will support classroom teachers incorporating physical activity and employing kinesthetic learning approaches into core subjects by providing annual professional development opportunities and resources, including information on leading activities, activity options, as well as making available background material on the connections between learning and movement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers will serve as role models by being physically active alongside the students whenever feasible.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT WELLNESS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will integrate wellness activities across the entire school setting, not just in the cafeteria, other food and beverage venues and physical activity facilities. &#160;The School District will coordinate and integrate other initiatives related to physical activity, physical education, nutrition and other wellness components so all efforts are complementary, not duplicative, and work towards the same set of goals and objectives promoting student well-being, optimal development and strong educational outcomes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Schools in the School District are encouraged to coordinate content across curricular areas that promote student health, such as teaching nutrition concepts in mathematics, with consultation provided by either the school or the School District’s curriculum experts.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All efforts related to obtaining federal, state or association recognition for efforts, or grants/funding opportunities for healthy school environments will be coordinated with and complementary of the wellness policy, including but not limited to ensuring the involvement of the DWC/SWC.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All school-sponsored events will adhere to the wellness policy guidelines. &#160;All school-sponsored wellness events will include physical activity and healthy eating opportunities when appropriate.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Community Partnerships</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will have relationships with community partners, such as the LSU Ag Center and SNAP Ed providers in support of this wellness policy’s implementation.&#160;&#160;Existing and new community partnerships and sponsorships will be evaluated to ensure that they are consistent with the wellness policy and its goals.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i><u>Community Health Promotion and Family Engagement</u></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School District will promote to parents/caregivers, families, and the general community the benefits of and approaches for healthy eating and physical activity throughout the school year. &#160;Families will be informed and invited to participate in school-sponsored activities and will receive information about health promotion efforts.&#160;&#160;These promotions will take place on the School District’s website at www.bpsb.us under the Administration and Child Nutrition Program tabs.</p>
