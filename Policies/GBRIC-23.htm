<p class="Title">MATERNITY AND ADOPTIVE LEAVE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MATERNITY LEAVE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board shall grant to regularly employed employees leave without pay for maternity purposes for a reasonable period of time before and after the birth of a child, not to exceed four (4) months.&#160;&#160;<i>Reasonable period of time</i> means that period during which the female employee is disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.&#160;&#160;<i>Regular employees,</i> for purposes of this policy, shall mean teachers serving under contract (not to include substitute teachers or teachers replacing others on leave) and other female employees who are employed by the School Board on a regular basis.&#160;&#160;Such leave shall be granted upon proper application to the School Board for maternity leave.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees may be permitted to use current and accumulated sick leave days in lieu of maternity leave upon proper request.&#160;&#160;The period of disability for which sick leave may be used shall be determined by the employee's physician, in conjunction with the employee and appropriate school personnel, and submitted to the School Board in writing.&#160;&#160;In no case, however, is the School Board required to provide for usage of sick leave for maternity leaves for a period exceeding six (6) weeks.&#160;&#160;Teachers permitted such sick leave shall comply fully with all sick leave regulations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, teachers granted maternity leave shall also be subject to all regulations affecting such leave.&#160;&#160;After the period of disability, the employee shall be responsible for submitting a medical statement certifying that the employee is able to return to work.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each employee granted maternity leave in accordance with state law who has no remaining sick leave days available may also be granted up to thirty (30) days of extended sick leave in each six-year period of employment in accordance with policy <i><a href="GBRIB-23.htm">GBRIB, Sick Leave</a></i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Application</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A pregnant employee may remain on the job as long as she is performing her duties competently as determined by her immediate supervisor.&#160;&#160;The employee shall fill out a <i>Maternity Leave Request</i> form, giving as much advance notice as possible, but in no case less than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning date of leave, except in emergency situations.&#160;&#160;The form must be accompanied by a statement from a physician verifying the state of pregnancy and expected dates of disability due to pregnancy.&#160;&#160;Such certificate shall follow the same standards as for submission of certificates for sick leave as found under <i>Certification of Absence</i> in policy <i><a href="GBRIB-23.htm">GBRIB, Sick Leave</a>.</i>&#160;&#160;Failure to comply with the notice and other requirements of this policy may be considered willful neglect of duty and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Guidelines</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The following steps should be considered when a maternity leave is being taken:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Maternity leave shall begin on the date requested by the employee and recommended by the physician.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee shall be eligible for re-employment to the position she left when she submits written notice from her physician that she is physically fit for full-time employment, and when she can give full assurance that care for the child will cause a minimal interference with job responsibilities.&#160;&#160;A teacher is guaranteed the position she held prior to being granted leave unless the position is eliminated.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-employment shall be guaranteed following the date that the individual was declared eligible for re-employment.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maternity leave for the period of disability occasioned by pregnancy and/or childbirth shall not interrupt the consecutive service for sabbatical leave purposes.&#160;&#160;Once maternity leave extends beyond the period of disability, however, such period of leave shall be considered an interruption of the accrual of consecutive semesters for sabbatical leave eligibility.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who takes maternity leave will keep her accumulated days intact when returning to her position.&#160;&#160;However, an employee who chooses to use her accumulated days will be required to take maternity leave at which time her accumulated days have all been used.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maternity leave is leave without pay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>ADOPTIVE LEAVE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall grant leaves of absence not to exceed thirty (30) days to regular employed teachers after the legal adoption of a child.&#160;&#160;If multiple children are adopted on the same date, the event shall be considered a single qualifying event.&#160;&#160;The granting of such leave shall not affect any of the tenure rights with the teacher may have acquired under state law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each employee granted adoptive leave in accordance with state law who has no remaining sick leave days available may also be granted up to thirty (30) days of extended sick leave in each six-year period of employment for personal illness related to illness of an infant, or for required medical visits certified by a physician as relating to infant health.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Adoptive leave shall not interrupt the consecutive service for sabbatical leave purposes.</p>
