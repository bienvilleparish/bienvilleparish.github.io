<p class="Title">INVESTIGATIONS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Concerns about serious situations or conditions within the school system 
 should be reported to the Superintendent or his/her designee.&#160;&#160;Should 
 the Superintendent determine that the situation/condition warrants investigation, 
 he/she shall have the matter investigated by appointing appropriate staff 
 personnel (one or more persons) to make the necessary inquiries. &#160;At 
 the conclusion of their investigation, a report shall be prepared for 
 submission to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any investigation undertaken in the school system shall be conducted 
 in accordance with the following stipulations:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>No Board member shall participate in any manner in an investigation.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The Superintendent shall use every means possible to protect 
	 School Board personnel from unwarranted personal criticism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In any investigation into incidents involving accidents or injuries 
 to students or employees, or involving student misconduct, or the competence, 
 honesty or performance of duties of employees, all employees of the Bienville 
 Parish School Board shall, upon reasonable request by the Superintendent 
 or his/her designee, give a statement of the facts and circumstances within 
 the employee's knowledge, or an accounting of the employee's conduct concerning 
 the circumstances which are the subject of the investigation or are related 
 to the matter being investigated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If deemed appropriate by the Superintendent or his/her designee in the 
 conduct of such investigation, employees shall, upon reasonable notification, 
 appear at the offices of the Superintendent or at such other suitable 
 location within the parish as might be appropriate and convenient in the 
 investigation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>During any such employee interview, the employee may have legal representation 
 if desired by the employee, but said representation shall be at no cost 
 to the Bienville Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF EMPLOYEE 
 DISCIPLINE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board, in accordance with state law, shall 
 provide for an investigation of an employee, in cases where the Board 
 has made a public announcement that an employee may be disciplined, whether 
 or not there is an accompanying reduction in pay.&#160;&#160;The investigation 
 shall proceed as outlined below under <i>Reporting Procedures</i>.&#160;&#160;Not 
 later than thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the investigation 
 and prior to any disciplinary action, the employee may appear, if he/she 
 so determines, before the School Board in open session and be given a 
 reasonable time, as determined by the Board, to comment on the investigation 
 and any actions taken or proposed to be taken involving the employee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>These provisions shall not be applicable to any reduction of personnel 
 initiated by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">IMPERMISSIBLE CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
 OR MORAL OFFENSES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If an employee is accused of impermissible corporal punishment, or of 
 a moral offense involving a student, a prompt, thorough investigation 
 shall be conducted by the Superintendent or designee. &#160;The investigation 
 shall proceed as outlined below under <i>Reporting Procedures.</i> &#160;A 
 written report of the results of the investigation shall be prepared, 
 and the employee shall be provided with a copy of such report.&#160;&#160;The 
 Superintendent may promulgate such administrative regulations as he/she 
 deems necessary to implement this policy.&#160;&#160;Any employee found 
 to have violated the provisions of Board policy shall be disciplined by 
 such means as appropriate to the incident, including reprimand, suspension, 
 termination, and/or referral to the local child protection agency/law 
 enforcement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the allegation falls within the definition of <i>abuse</i> as defined 
 in Board policy <i><a href="JGCE-18.htm">JGCE, Child Abuse</a></i>, then 
 all school employees with knowledge of such incidents become <i>mandatory 
 reporters</i> and the allegations must be reported to child protection 
 or law enforcement as provided by state law and Board policy.&#160;&#160;Such 
 reporting shall be made and applied in conjunction with the procedures 
 outlined in this policy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">REPORTING PROCEDURES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any statute or other Board policy, any complaint relative 
 to employee conduct shall be handled as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>The Superintendent or his/her designee may order such investigation 
	 to be conducted in each instance as is warranted by the circumstances.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The investigation shall be conducted by the Superintendent or 
	 his/her designee.&#160;&#160;These rules contemplate informal but 
	 thorough investigations, affording all interested persons and their 
	 representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant 
	 to the complaint.&#160;&#160;Staff members or students may be interviewed 
	 if it is deemed essential to the investigation.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The Superintendent or his/her designee shall confer with each 
	 accused employee’s immediate supervisor concerning the results of 
	 the investigation and the immediate supervisor shall discuss the matter 
	 with the employee.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>A written determination as to the validity of the complaint 
	 and a description of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the 
	 Superintendent or designee and a copy forwarded to the complainant 
	 no later than (30) days after its filing.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>If charges are substantiated, disciplinary action may be taken 
	 in accordance with Board policy, based upon investigative evidence 
	 gathered, which may include termination of employment of the employee.&#160;&#160;Any 
	 disciplinary action shall be placed in the offender's personnel file 
	 which will reflect the action taken and the grounds thereof.</p></li>
