<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p class="Title">COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board believes it is necessary for all persons to become aware of acceptable use of computers.&#160;&#160;Any person using computers or other electronic information resources shall be required to use such equipment and resources in a responsible, legal manner.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Age and grade appropriate classroom instruction shall be provided regarding Internet and cell phone safety.&#160;&#160;Such instruction shall include appropriate online behavior, interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and cyberbullying awareness and response, as well as areas of concern as authorized in state and federal law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, the School Board, in conjunction with local law enforcement agencies, shall develop and distribute age and grade appropriate information to each student regarding Internet and cell phone safety and online content that is a threat to school safety.&#160;&#160;The information shall include the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>Instruction on how to detect potential threats to school safety exhibited online, including posting on any social media platform.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual examples of possible threats.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process for reporting potential threats, which shall be in accordance with the procedures referenced in policy <i><a href="EBBB-23.htm">EBBB, School and Student Safety</a>.</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Such information shall be either distributed to or explained to students and school personnel at the beginning of each school year and shall be posted on an easily accessible page of the School Boardâ€™s website and the website of each school.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If information reported to a school is deemed a potential threat to school safety, the school shall present the written form and any further evidence to local law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board retains the right to monitor all computer usage and files for compliance to all regulations and/or procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Internet is a vast global computer network that provides access to major universities around the world, governmental agencies, other school systems, and commercial providers of data banks.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall establish appropriate guidelines for exploring and using Internet resources within the school district to enhance learning and teaching activities.&#160;&#160;Acceptable use of these resources shall be consistent with the philosophy, goals and objectives of the Bienville Parish School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall incorporate the use of computer-related technology or the use of Internet service provider technology designed to block access or exposure to any harmful materials or information, such as sites that contain obscene, pornographic, pervasively vulgar, excessively violent, or sexually harassing information or material.&#160;&#160;Sites which contain information on the manufacturing of bombs or other incendiary devices shall also be prohibited.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board does not prohibit authorized employees or students from having unfiltered or unrestricted access to Internet or online services, including online services of newspapers with daily circulation of at least 1,000, for legitimate scientific or educational purposes approved by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Exploration of the Internet is encouraged, but with rights and privileges come responsibility.&#160;&#160;Any use of the Internet that adversely affects its operation in pursuit of teaching and learning or jeopardizes its use or performance for other community members is prohibited and may result in loss of Internet privileges, suspension or other appropriate disciplinary action.&#160;&#160;The School Board does not condone the use of the Internet for any illegal or inappropriate activities and shall not be responsible for any such use by staff or students.&#160;&#160;Parents shall be made aware that Internet usage is only partially controllable by supervision.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>USE OF THE INTERNET</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students may use the Internet only if the Internet Usage Contract has been properly signed, filed at the school site, and approved by appropriate School District personnel and then only in accordance with School District regulations governing such usage.&#160;&#160;School system personnel and other authorized persons may use the Internet only if the Internet Usage Contract has been properly signed, approved by appropriate personnel and filed at the user's site.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any person using computers or other electronic information resources shall be required to use such equipment and resources in a responsible, legal manner.&#160;&#160;The School Board retains the right to monitor all computer usage and files for compliance to all regulations and/or procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>USE OF INTERNET REGULATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board believes that there are appropriate regulations to maximize effective educational use of the Internet and minimize abuse of the opportunity being provided to our schools.&#160;&#160;Ethical, efficient and legal use of any network is the key to a successful linkage with the Internet.&#160;&#160;All users, including students, employees, or any other users of School Board computers, hardware, and School Board network shall abide by all policies of the School Board and any applicable administrative regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
