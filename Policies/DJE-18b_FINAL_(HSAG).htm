<p class="Title" style="font-size: 12pt;">PURCHASING</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All purchasing for the school system to be paid from Bienville Parish 
 School Board funds shall be made by the Superintendent or his/her designee 
 in conformance with existing regulations and procedures of the School 
 Board and the laws pertinent to state and federal agencies.&#160;&#160;Budget 
 allocations for specific purposes shall constitute advance School Board 
 approval for all purchases except in such cases as state law or School 
 Board policy may require. &#160;No debt shall be contracted in the name 
 of the Bienville Parish School Board without action by the School Board, 
 except those items which are provided for in the regular budget. &#160;Purchases 
 shall be made at the lowest possible cost to the school system consistent 
 with the system specifications of quality and service.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each principal shall assure that purchases by the individual school 
 shall be made in accordance with applicable state and federal law and 
 administrative regulations and procedures developed by the Superintendent 
 and staff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No employee, officer or agent of the School Board shall participate 
 in the selection, award, or administration of a contract or purchase of 
 supplies, materials and equipment if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, 
 would be involved.&#160;&#160;School Board employees shall neither solicit 
 nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, 
 potential contractors, or parties to subagreements.&#160;&#160;All purchasing 
 shall comply with the U.S. Department of Education Department <i>General 
 Administrative Regulations</i> (EDGAR), the <i>Louisiana Public Bid Law</i>, 
 the <i>Louisiana Code of Governmental Ethics</i>, the <i>Louisiana Procurement 
 Code</i>, and applicable state or federal regulations, as applicable.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PROCUREMENT METHOD</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><b><u>USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS</u></b></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All procurement of materials, supplies, and services, as well as the 
 construction of public works, funded in whole or in part with federal 
 funds shall comply with the requirements contained in Title 2, Section 
 200, of the Code of Federal Regulations. &#160;All procurements using 
 federal funds, in whole or in part, shall employ one of the procedures 
 identified in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=42ca6a0fc6e89bc66ace6753bf67bf38&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se2.1.200_1320&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">2 CFR 200.320</a>, if more stringent 
 that those procedures required by Louisiana law. &#160;Should the School 
 Board adopt the Louisiana Procurement Code, whether in part or in its 
 entirety, the accompanying administrative regulations as promulgated in 
 the Louisiana Procurement Code, as well as guidelines and policies issued 
 by the Louisiana’s Office of State Purchasing relevant to the particular 
 adoption(s) may be applicable to the purchase, if more stringent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Solicitations from Small and Minority Businesses, Women’s Business 
 Enterprises, and Labor Surplus Area Firms</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When spending federal funds, the Bienville Parish School Board shall 
 take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority businesses, 
 women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
 possible.&#160;&#160;Affirmative steps shall include:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women’s 
	 business enterprises on solicitation lists;<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women’s business 
	 enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
	 smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small 
	 and minority businesses and women’s business enterprises;<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
	 which encourage participation by small and minority businesses and 
	 women’s business enterprises;<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations 
	 as the Louisiana Economic Development Agency, and Small Business Administration 
	 and the Minority Business Development Agency of the United States 
	 Department of Commerce; and<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
	 to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs 1 through 5 of 
	 this section.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Exclusion or Rejection of Quotes or Bids</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A contract award or a purchase made with federal funds shall not be 
 made to parties listed on the government-wide exclusions in the <i>System 
 for Award Management</i> maintained by the U.S. Government, which contains 
 the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, 
 as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><b><u>USE OF STATE FUNDS</u></b></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Procurement of materials and supplies when using state or locally generated 
 funds shall follow the procurement method authorized by Louisiana law.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Financing Purchases</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may finance the purchase of equipment or other movable 
 property to be used by the School Board by entering into an installment 
 sale, lease, or similar agreement with any lender or other person.&#160;&#160;If 
 required, such agreement shall be subject to approval of the State Bond 
 Commission in accordance with statutory provisions. &#160;No individual 
 school or employee shall obligate the School Board without proper school 
 system personnel knowledge and approval.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Use of State Contract</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If equipment, materials or supplies are available from a State of Louisiana 
 Contract, the Superintendent and/or his/her designee may approve the purchase 
 without using one of the purchasing procedures outlined in statutory provisions, 
 if advantageous to the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may also <i>piggyback,</i> or purchase materials and 
 supplies on valid contracts of other political subdivisions in accordance 
 with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:1321-1337 or La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a19" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/380321-1.htm');return false;">38:321.1</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Louisiana Procurement Code</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>State law authorizes School Boards to adopt all or any part of the <i>Louisiana 
 Procurement Code</i> as contained in state statutes (La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 
 §§39:1551-39:1755).&#160;&#160;For proper and efficient operations, the 
 Bienville Parish School Board may adopt, by resolution or otherwise, pertinent 
 provisions of the <i>Louisiana Procurement Code</i>, accompanying administrative 
 regulations as promulgated in the <i>Louisiana Procurement Code</i>, as 
 well as guidelines and policies issued by the state’s Office of State 
 Purchasing relevant to the procurement of materials, supplies, merchandise, 
 and other types of property.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Sole Source Provider</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may award a contract for the purchase of supplies, 
 services, or major repairs without competition when the Superintendent 
 or designated employee has determined, in writing, that there is only 
 one source for the supply, service, or major repair item(s) to be acquired.&#160;&#160;Pertinent 
 procedures for purchasing such items from a sole source shall be as outlined 
 in the State of Louisiana Office of State Purchasing's <i>Purchasing Rules 
 and Regulations.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Qualified Group Purchasing Organizations</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>qualified group purchasing organization</i> means an organization, 
 whether for profit or not for profit, of which two (2) or more public 
 school districts are members and which solicits proposals or bids from 
 vendors of materials, equipment, or supplies of the type and nature as 
 may be purchased by a public school district or public school.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a20" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/382212-1.htm');return false;">38:2212.1</a>, the 
 School Board may enter into an agreement with: &#160;(A) one or more School 
 Boards to form a qualified group purchasing organization; or (B) one or 
 more qualified group purchasing organizations for the purchase of materials, 
 equipment, and supplies, including installation thereof.&#160;&#160;Any 
 such agreement shall require that the qualified group purchasing organization 
 submit a price list for those materials, equipment, and supplies offered 
 by it and that the prices quoted on the list remain in effect for a stated 
 period of time of not less than three (3) months. &#160;Any such price 
 list shall be considered, for all purposes, to be a valid and binding 
 bid by the qualified group purchasing organization during the effective 
 period of the agreement, and no additional bid by the qualified group 
 purchasing organization is necessary.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may purchase materials, equipment, or supplies directly 
 from or through a qualified group purchasing organization if the price 
 is less than that for the same or substantially similar materials, equipment, 
 or supplies on the state contract or&#160;&#160;bid list.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Competitive Online Solicitation</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board may use a <i>reverse auction</i> or <i>competitive 
 online solicitation</i> <i>process</i> on the Internet for the purchase 
 of equipment, supplies, and other materials in lieu of the more formal 
 bid process when the School Board’s procurement officer determines that 
 the electronic bidding is more advantageous and in the best interests 
 of the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Prior to the use of a competitive online solicitation process, the School 
 Board may require that:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Vendors register before opening dates and time, and as part 
	 of the registration, require that the vendors agree to any terms and 
	 conditions and other requirements of the solicitation.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Vendors be prequalified prior to placing bids and allow only 
	 bidders who are prequalified to submit bids.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The solicitation shall designate an opening date and time and 
	 the closing date and time.&#160;&#160;The closing date and time may 
	 be fixed or remain open depending on the structure of the item being 
	 bid.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>At the opening date and time, the School Board shall begin accepting 
	 online bids and continue accepting bids until the bidding is officially 
	 closed.&#160;&#160;Registered bidders shall be allowed to lower the 
	 price of their bid below the lowest bid posted on the Internet until 
	 the closing date and time.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Bidders’ identities shall not be revealed during the bidding 
	 process; only the successively lower prices, ranks, scores, and related 
	 bid details shall be revealed.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>All bids shall be posted electronically and updated on a real-time 
	 basis.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The School Board shall retain the right to cancel the solicitation 
	 if it determines that it is in the School Board’s best interest.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The School Board shall retain its existing authority to determine 
	 the criteria that will be used as a basis for making awards.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Adequate public notice for purchases using a reverse auction or competitive 
 online solicitation process shall be given as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>The advertisement or notice shall be published two (2) times 
	 in a newspaper in the locality, the first advertisement to appear 
	 at least fifteen (15) days before the opening date of the reverse 
	 auction.&#160;&#160;In addition to the newspaper advertisement, the 
	 School Board may also publish an advertisement by electronic media 
	 available to the general public.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>The first publication of the advertisement shall not occur on 
	 a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>VENDORS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall seek business and bids from all eligible vendors, 
 regardless of race, creed, color, sex, national origin, age or handicap.&#160;&#160;No 
 favoritism shall be extended to any vendor.&#160;&#160;Each order shall 
 be placed on the basis of quality, price and delivery; past services being 
 a factor if all other considerations are equal.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No person officially connected with or employed by the School Board 
 shall be an agent for, or have any pecuniary or beneficial interest in 
 or receive any compensation or reward from any vendor for the sale of 
 supplies, materials, equipment, services or public works contracts.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No employee of the School Board shall solicit or accept, directly or 
 indirectly, anything of economic value as a gift or gratuity from any 
 vendor representative or agent of a vendor, or a prospective vendor or 
 contractor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Vendors may set up an appointment to see the principal with written 
 prior approval from the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;The principal may present 
 the information to the appropriate staff member.&#160;&#160;If the staff 
 member wishes to set up an appointment with the vendor to discuss products 
 offered, he or she may do so.</p>
