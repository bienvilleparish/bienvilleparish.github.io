<p class="Title">TESTING PROGRAM</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board shall take every precaution to assure 
 that all tests administered within the school system shall be conducted 
 in such a manner so as not to compromise in any way the testing results.&#160;&#160;For 
 criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, alternate assessments and certain 
 other tests administered by or through the Louisiana Board of Elementary 
 and Secondary Education (BESE), testing materials and procedures, as well 
 as any electronic data, computer media, or passwords related to student 
 testing, shall be properly supervised in strict compliance with regulations 
 outlined by BESE and the School Board.&#160;&#160;In addition, all secure 
 tests, answer documents, student log-in information,&#160;and supplementary 
 secure materials shall be stored under lock and key in designated areas 
 when not in use.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: windowtext; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Employees shall 
 be responsible for reporting irregularities or improprieties in the administration 
 of standardized tests.&#160;&#160;Although procedures for reporting irregularities 
 to district personnel are listed below, employees may report such information 
 directly to the Louisiana Department of Education, which shall investigate 
 the allegations.&#160;&#160;No employee shall make a report of irregularities 
 or improprieties in the administration of standardized tests knowing that 
 the information included is false.&#160;&#160;No employee shall knowingly 
 obstruct the procedures for receiving and investigating a report of irregularities 
 or improprieties in the administration of standardized tests.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: windowtext; letter-spacing: 0pt;">No public school 
 administrator or member of a School Board shall retaliate against an employee 
 who in good faith participates in an investigation of testing administration 
 improprieties or irregularities.&#160;&#160;Retaliation shall include 
 discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or discriminating 
 of an employee who in good faith reports testing administration improprieties 
 or irregularities.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DEFINITIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Access</i>—access to secure test materials means physically handling 
 the materials, not reading, reviewing, or analyzing test items or student 
 responses, either before, during, or after testing, except where providing 
 approved accommodations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Secure Materials</i>―test materials 
 that contain test items or student responses and to which access is restricted. 
 &#160;Secure test materials include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>student test booklets;</p></li>
	<li><p>student answer documents;</p></li>
	<li><p>student log-in information; and</p></li>
	<li><p>any other materials that contain test items or student responses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Testing Irregularity</i>―any incident 
 in test handling or administration that leads to a question regarding 
 the security of the test or the accuracy of the test data.</p>

 devices with imaging or text-messaging capabilities that are the property 
 of students, test administrators, and school test coordinators must be 
 placed in and remain in the off position while test booklets and answer 
 documents are in the vicinity.&#160;&#160;Except for devices required 
 for approved accommodations or online assessments, if a student is in 
 possession of and/or uses a cell phone or electronic device in any manner 
 during the administration of a statewide test, the phone or electronic 
 device will be confiscated until assurance can be evidenced that all traces 
 of information, in print, image, or verbal form, have been removed from 
 all local and cloud storage and that no such traces remain on the device.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If evidence exists on the cell phone or 
 other electronic device that indicates the device was used during the 
 test administration and/or test material was recorded and/or transmitted, 
 the student’s score shall be voided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Violation of the no cell phone or electronic 
 device rule may result in discipline in accordance with School Board policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -1.0in;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testing shall be conducted in class-sized 
 groups.&#160;&#160;Permission for testing in environments that differ 
 from the usual classroom environment (excluding computer labs used for 
 online testing) must be obtained in writing from the <i>Louisiana Department 
 of Education, Division of</i> <i>Assessments and Accountability</i> at

 Assessments</i> <i>and Accountability</i>, the School Board shall provide 
 at least one proctor for every thirty (30) students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the extent practicable, the School Board

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall also maintain administrative

 security procedures are being followed and to observe test administration 
 procedures.</p>
<p style="margin-left: .5in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -.5in;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>CONDITIONS AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The State Superintendent of Education may 
 disallow test results which may have been achieved in a manner which is 
 violative of test security.&#160;&#160;In addition:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>In cases where test results are not accepted because of breach 
	 of test security or action by the Louisiana Department of Education, 
	 any programmatic, evaluative, or graduation criteria dependent upon 
	 the data shall be deemed not to have been met.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Anyone known to be involved in the presentation of forged, counterfeit, 
	 or altered identification for the purposes of obtaining admission 
	 to a test administration site for any test administered by or through 
	 the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education or the Louisiana 
	 Department of Education shall have breached test security.&#160;&#160;Any 
	 individual(s) or student who knowingly causes or allows the presentation 
	 of forged, counterfeit, or altered identification for the purpose 
	 of obtaining admission to any test administration site shall forfeit 
	 all test scores and will be allowed to retake the test at the next 
	 test administration.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Test scores may be voided at the school level in cases of cheating 
	 or other violations of test security.&#160;&#160;When either cheating 
	 or the violation of test security is suspected, a committee to include 
	 at least the principal, school test coordinator, and test administrator 
	 shall be convened to determine whether or not a score should be voided.&#160;&#160;A 
	 written report documenting and describing the incident(s) shall be 
	 completed.&#160;&#160;In the event the decision is made to void scores 
	 because of cheating, the student and parents shall be notified and 
	 offered an opportunity for a hearing to be conducted by the principal 
	 with the test administrator and school test coordinator also present. 
	 &#160;The principal shall make the final decision regarding voiding 
	 of test scores or breach of ethics. &#160;If the decision is made 
	 to void test scores, the school test coordinator must submit a letter 
	 on school letterhead with the principal's and school test coordinator's 
	 signatures to the District Test Coordinator.&#160;&#160;Attached to 
	 the letter should be the written record of the breach of security 
	 or cheating, dates and times of all meetings/hearings relating to 
	 the incidents with signatures of all present at these meetings/hearings, 
	 and documentation of phone calls to parents.&#160;&#160;Any witnesses 
	 to cheating or breach of security should complete a written statement 
	 describing the incident and sign and date the statement. &#160;These 
	 should be submitted with the written report.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Any teacher or other personnel who breaches test security or 
	 allows breaches in test security shall be disciplined in accordance 
	 with the provisions of School Board policy and regulations adopted 
	 by the BESE and any applicable state laws.&#160;&#160;Any violation 
	 of test security or breach of ethics on the part of an employee of 
	 the Bienville Parish School Board before, during, or after testing 
	 (including erasure analysis and/or other evidence that results in 
	 the voiding of test scores) shall be investigated by the District 
	 Test Coordinator.&#160;&#160;If the violation occurred at the school 
	 level, the building principal shall participate in the investigation.&#160;&#160;In 
	 the event sufficient evidence exists to support a violation in test 
	 security or breach of ethics, a written report shall be submitted 
	 to the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;A hearing shall be conducted by 
	 the Superintendent with the employee(s) under investigation, the District 
	 Test Coordinator, the building principal, and the Director of Personnel 
	 present.&#160;&#160;If the Superintendent determines that a violation 
	 of test security or breach of ethics has occurred, appropriate recommendations 
	 for disciplinary action shall be made and action taken in accordance 
	 with School Board policy.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>In the event that an employee has participated in activities 
	 to provide answers or otherwise alter test scores, the recommendation 
	 will be dismissal.&#160;&#160;All evidence of violations of test security 
	 and breach of ethics reported to the Superintendent by the Louisiana 
	 Department of Education shall require a written report from those 
	 suspected of violations, the building principal, and the school test 
	 coordinator regardless of whether or not the claims are substantiated.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Anonymous complaints received by either the Superintendent or 
	 the District Test Coordinator regarding violations of test security 
	 or breach of ethics shall be investigated by the District Test Coordinator.&#160;&#160;If 
	 evidence exists to support the complaint(s), appropriate action as 
	 described above shall be initiated.</p></li>
