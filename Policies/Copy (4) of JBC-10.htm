 OF EXPELLED STUDENTS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No student who has been expelled in accordance 
 with state law from any school in the state shall be admitted to any school 
 in the school system except upon the review and approval of the School 
 Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

 when a request for admission has been made to the Board.</p>
