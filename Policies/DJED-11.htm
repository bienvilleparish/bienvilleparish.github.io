<p class="Title">BIDS AND QUOTATIONS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">PUBLIC WORKS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board shall advertise and let by contract, 
 except in cases of emergencies as provided below, all public work exceeding 
 $150,000 or such sum as allowed by law, including labor, materials, equipment, 
 and administrative overhead not to exceed fifteen percent (15%).&#160;&#160;The 
 contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder who has bid 
 according to the contract, plans, and specifications advertised.&#160;&#160;Public 
 works which are estimated to cost less than the contract limit may be 
 undertaken by the School Board with its own employees.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As an evidence of good faith of the bidder, the School Board shall require 
 bidders for construction, improvement, repair, or other work to attach 
 to the bid submitted, a bid bond, certified check, or cashier's check 
 for not more than five percent (5%) of the contract work to be done.&#160;&#160;The 
 School Board may require a bid bond or certified or cashier's check of 
 not more than five percent (5%) of the estimated price on bids taken for 
 supplies and materials.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When any bid is accepted for construction or doing any public works, 
 a written contract shall be entered into by the successful bidder and 
 the School Board, and the successful bidder shall furnish a bond in an 
 amount not less than one-half of the amount of the contract, for the faithful 
 performance of his or her duties.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Under no circumstances shall there be a division or separation of any 
 public work project into smaller projects, which division or separation 
 would have the effect of avoiding the requirement that public work be 
 advertised and let by contract to the lowest responsible bidder in accordance 
 with statutory provisions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall retain the option of requiring all bids that 
 are let out for public works be submitted electronically.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All purchases of materials or supplies exceeding the sum of $30,000 
 to be paid out of public funds shall be advertised and let by contract 
 to the lowest responsible bidder who has bid according to the specifications 
 as advertised.&#160;&#160;In addition, purchases of materials or supplies 
 of at least $10,000, but not more than $30,000, shall be made by obtaining 
 not less than three (3) telephone or facsimile quotations.&#160;&#160;A 
 written confirmation of the accepted offer shall be obtained and made 
 a part of the purchase file.&#160;&#160;The School Board may require a 
 written contract or bond when purchasing the materials or supplies.&#160;&#160;If 
 quotations are received that are lower than the quote accepted, a notation 
 shall be entered into the file as to the reasons for rejection of the 
 lower quotes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Purchases cannot be divided by departments or by a school if the effect 
 is to evade the state's public bid law.&#160;&#160;Purchases of commodities 
 that are bought in small but recurring amounts through the year shall 
 be bid on an annual basis.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall retain the option of requiring all bids that 
 are let out for materials and supplies be submitted electronically.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In lieu of formal bids, the School Board may use a <i>reverse auction</i> 
 or <i>competitive online solicitation process</i> for the purchase of 
 equipment, supplies, and other materials, as outlined in policy <i><a href="DJE-18b_FINAL_(HSAG).htm">DJE, Purchasing</a></i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">EMERGENCIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In cases of an emergency or extreme emergency when time is not sufficient 
 to advertise for bids for public works or purchase of materials, the School 
 Board or designee is permitted by law to declare that a public emergency 
 or extreme public emergency exists and extend a contract for more than 
 the sums mentioned without going out to bid; however, in such cases every 
 effort shall be made by the administration to secure competitive quotations 
 through negotiations.&#160;&#160;State law permits a person designated 
 by the School Board to declare the existence of an <i>extreme public emergency</i>.&#160;&#160;Notices 
 of an <i>emergency</i> or <i>extreme emergency</i> shall be published 
 in the School Board’s official journal within ten (10) days of the emergency 
 being certified by the School Board or designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">BID ADVERTISEMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All advertisements for bids for public works shall appear in the newspaper 
 selected as the official journal for the School Board, except in emergencies 
 as may be declared by the School Board.&#160;&#160;Any advertisement for 
 any contract for public works, when published, shall appear once a week 
 for three (3) different weeks in a newspaper in the locality and the first 
 advertisement shall appear at least twenty-five (25) days before the opening 
 of bids.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any advertisement for any contract or purchase of materials or supplies 
 shall be published two (2) times in a newspaper in the locality, the first 
 advertisement appearing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the opening 
 of bids.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to newspaper advertisements, the School Board shall also 
 publish advertisements and accept bids by electronic media in accordance 
 with uniform standards promulgated by the state.&#160;&#160;In any advertisement, 
 the first publication shall not occur on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
 holiday.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the School Board issues or causes to be issued on a public work exceeding 
 the contract limit set by state law, any addendum modifying plans and 
 specifications within a period of seven (7) days prior to the advertised 
 time for opening of bids, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and any other 
 legal holidays, the School Board shall transmit a copy of the addendum 
 to all prime bidders who have requested bid documents.&#160;&#160;The 
 transmission shall be completed within twenty-four (24) hours of the issuance 
 of the addendum, and may be delivered by either facsimile transmission 
 (fax), e-mail, other electronic means, or by hand provided the prime bidder 
 has supplied the fax number or e-mail address to the School Board.&#160;&#160;In 
 addition, a copy of the addendum shall be sent by regular mail.&#160;&#160;If 
 the addendum cannot be transmitted by fax, e-mail, other electronic means, 
 or hand delivered, the School Board shall be required to postpone the 
 bid opening by at least seven (7) days.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall not issue or cause to be issued any addendum 
 modifying plans and specifications within a period of seventy-two (72) 
 hours prior to the advertised time for the opening of bids, excluding 
 Saturdays, Sundays, and any other legal holidays; however, if the necessity 
 arises to issue an addendum modifying plans and specifications within 
 the seventy-two (72) hour period prior to the advertised time for the 
 opening of bids, then the opening of bids shall be extended at least seven 
 (7), but not more than twenty-one (21) working days, without the requirement 
 of readvertising.&#160;&#160;The addendum shall state the revised time 
 and date for the opening of bids.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">OPENING OF BIDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All bids shall be opened in public in the presence of one or more witnesses, 
 at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids.&#160;&#160;Each 
 bid, together with the name of the bidder, shall be recorded and open 
 to public inspection.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board shall not accept 
 or take any bids including receiving any hand delivered bids, on days 
 which are recognized as holidays by the United States Postal Service.&#160;&#160;The 
 Superintendent and/or other appropriate administrators shall review, summarize 
 and report bids to the School Board with recommendations for final action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the School Board proposes to disqualify any bidder, the School Board 
 shall:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Give written notice of the proposed disqualification to such 
	 bidder, and include in the written notice all reasons for the proposed 
	 disqualification; and<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>Give such bidder, who is proposed to be disqualified, the opportunity 
	 to be heard at an informal hearing, at which such bidder is afforded 
	 the opportunity to refute the reasons for the disqualification.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline; ">EXCLUSION/REJECTION OF BIDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board, after the opening of bids, shall require each bidder 
 or bidding entity to attest or submit an attestation that the sole proprietor, 
 partner, incorporator, director, manager, officer, or other like individual 
 who owns at least ten percent (10%) of the bidding entity, has not been 
 convicted of, or has not entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere (no 
 contest) to any of the crimes or equivalent federal crimes listed in La. 
 Rev. Stat. Ann. §<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="a17" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" onmouseover="if (parseInt(navigator.appVersion) >= 4 &amp;&amp; typeof(BSPSPopupOnMouseOver) == 'function') BSPSPopupOnMouseOver(event);" class="BSSCPopup" onclick="BSSCPopup('../Statutes/382227.htm');return false;">38:2227</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In awarding bids or contracts, the School Board shall be authorized 
 to reject the lowest bid from a business in which any individual with 
 ownership interest of five percent (5%) or more has been convicted of, 
 pled guilty or nolo contendere to any a state felony crime or equivalent 
 federal crime committed in the solicitation or execution of a contract 
 or bid under the state laws governing public contracts; professional, 
 personal, consulting, and social services procurement; or the Louisiana 
 Procurement Code.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any contract between the School Board and a person or entity entered 
 into as a result of fraud, bribery, corruption, or other criminal acts, 
 for which a final conviction has been obtained, shall be null and void.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any person whose conviction causes the nullity of a contract shall be 
 responsible for payment of all costs, attorney fees, and damages incurred 
 in the rebidding of the contract.</p>
