<p class="Title">EMPLOYEE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board recognizes the importance of incorporating current technology tools, including new methods of electronic communication, into the classroom to enhance student learning.&#160;&#160;It further recognizes the importance of employees, students and parents engaging, learning, collaborating and sharing in digital environments.&#160;&#160;The School Board strives to ensure that electronic communication tools incorporated into the school curriculum are used responsibly and safely.&#160;&#160;As practicable, the School Board shall provide access to secure social media tools and approved technologies for use during instructional time and for school activities in accordance with policy <i><span class="Hyperlink" style="color: windowtext; text-underline: none;"><a href="IFBGA-18.htm">IFBGA, Computer Access and Use</a></span>.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board acknowledges that employees may engage in the use of social media during their personal time.&#160;&#160;Employees who use social media for personal purposes must be mindful that they are responsible for their public conduct even when not acting in their capacities as school district employees.&#160;&#160;All employees, including student teachers and independent contractors, shall comply with the requirements of this policy when using electronic social media for personal purposes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For the purposes of this policy, <i>social media</i> includes, but is not limited to, personal websites, web logs (blogs), wikis, social network sites, online forums, virtual worlds, video-sharing websites and any other social media generally available to the public or consumers that does not fall within the School Board's technologies network (e.g., Web 2.0 tools, lnstagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Linkedln, Flickr, YouTube).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVING STUDENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall maintain professional relationships with students at all times in accordance with School Board policy including, but not limited to, policies <i><a href="GAMIA-12.htm">GAMIA, Electronic Communications Between Employees and Students</a></i><i>,</i> and <a href="GBRA-11.htm"><i>GBRA,</i> <i>Employee Conduct</i></a><i>.</i>&#160;&#160;All electronic communications with students who are currently enrolled in the school district must be school related and within the scope of the employees' professional responsibilities, unless otherwise authorized by this policy.&#160;&#160;School personnel using School Board-controlled technological resources and social media tools to communicate directly with students or to comment on student matters through use of the Internet shall abide by all policies governing such activities.&#160;&#160;An employee seeking to utilize and/or establish a non-school-controlled social media website for instructional or other school-related purposes shall obtain prior written approval from the Superintendent or his/her designee and the principal and meet any applicable requirements of policy <i><a href="IFBGA-18.htm">IFBGA, Computer Access and Use</a></i><i>.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The use of electronic media for communicating with students and parents on school matters is considered an extension of the employee's workplace responsibilities.&#160;&#160;Accordingly, the Bienville Parish School Board shall expect employees to use professional judgment when using social media or other electronic communications.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall be prohibited from knowingly communicating with students through a personal social network page.&#160;&#160;Any electronic communication made by an employee to any student enrolled in a public school in this school district or that is received by an employee from any student enrolled in a public school in this school district using a means other than one provided by or made available by the school district shall be reported immediately by the employee to his/her immediate supervisor, in writing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>EMPLOYEE PERSONAL USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board respects the right of employees to use social media as a medium of self-expression on their personal time.&#160;&#160;As role models for the School District's students, however, employees shall be responsible for their public conduct even when they are not performing their job duties as employees of the School Board. &#160;Employees shall be held to the same professional standards in their public use of social media and other electronic communications as they are for any other public conduct. &#160;Furthermore, employees remain subject to applicable state and federal laws, School Board policies, and administrative regulations and procedures, even if communicating with others concerning personal and private matters.&#160;&#160;If an employee's use of social media interferes with the employeeâ€™s ability to effectively perform his or her job duties or causes a substantial disruption to the school environment, the employee shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall be responsible for the content on their social media sites, including content added by the employee, the employee's friends, or members of the public who can access the employee's site, and for Web links on the employee's site.&#160;&#160;Employees shall take reasonable precautions, such as using available security settings, to restrict students from viewing their personal information on social media websites and to prevent students from accessing materials that are not age-appropriate.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Employees shall be prohibited from accessing social networking websites for personal use during instructional time or with School Board technological resources.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>POSTING TO SOCIAL MEDIA SITES</u></p>
