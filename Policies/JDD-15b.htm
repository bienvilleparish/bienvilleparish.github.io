<p class="Title">SUSPENSION</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board recognizes its authority to maintain 
 good order and discipline within the schools of the school district.&#160;&#160;Therefore, 
 the School Board recognizes the principal's authority to suspend a pupil 
 for a specified period of time in accordance with statutory provisions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: .9pt;">In each case of suspension, the school principal, 
 or his or her designee, prior to any suspension, shall advise the student 
 of the particular misconduct of which he/she is accused as well as the 
 basis for such accusation, and the pupil shall be given an opportunity 
 at that time to explain his/her version of the facts.&#160;&#160;The principal/designee 
 shall contact the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of the pupil to notify 
 them of the suspension, and establish a date and time for a conference 
 with the principal or designee as a requirement for readmitting the pupil.&#160;&#160;Notice 
 shall be given by contacting the parent, tutor, or legal guardian by telephone 
 at the telephone number shown on the pupil's registration card, or by 
 sending a certified letter to the address shown on the pupil's registration 
 card.&#160;&#160;The principal shall promptly advise the Superintendent 
 or designee of all such suspensions, stating the reasons for the suspensions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .9pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: .9pt;">Students suspended for more than ten (10) 
 days shall remain under the supervision of the school system using an 
 alternative education program designed to continue the educational process 
 in an alternative educational placement.&#160;&#160;The student shall 
 be placed in an alternative school or an alternative education program 
 and shall be required to attend and participate in such school, program, 
 or educational services.</p>
<p style="text-indent: .9pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: .9pt;">No suspended pupil shall be allowed to leave 
 the school premises during the school day until the parent, guardian, 
 or other proper authorities assume responsibility for him/her, unless 
 immediate removal from school due to danger or threat of disruption to 
 academic process is warranted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If the parent, tutor, or legal guardian fails to attend the required 
 conference within five (5) school days of notification, the truancy laws 
 shall be effective.&#160;&#160;On not more than one occasion each school 
 year when the parent, tutor, or legal guardian refuses to respond to the 
 notice, the principal may determine whether readmitting the pupil is in 
 the best interest of the pupil.&#160;&#160;On any subsequent occasions 
 in the same school year, the pupil shall not be readmitted unless the 
 parent, tutor, or legal guardian, court, or other appointed representative 
 responds.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In any case where a teacher, principal, or other school employee is 
 authorized to require the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of a pupil 
 to attend a conference or meeting regarding the pupil's behavior and after 
 notice, the parent, tutor, or legal guardian willfully refuses to attend, 
 the principal or his/her designee shall file a complaint, in accordance 
 with statutory provisions, with a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When a pupil is suspended for a second time within one school year, 
 the principal may require a counseling session be held with the parent 
 and pupil by the school counselor. &#160;If no counselor is available, 
 the conference may be held with all the pupil's teachers and the principal 
 or other administrator.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student, <i>after being suspended on three (3) occasions</i> for 
 committing drugs or weapons offenses during the same school year, <b>shall</b> 
 <i>upon committing the fourth</i> <i>offense</i>, be expelled from all 
 the public schools of the system until the beginning of the next regular 
 school year, and the pupil's reinstatement shall be subject to the review 
 and approval of the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal and other appropriate personnel shall be required to file 
 written documentation of all suspensions.&#160;&#160;Said documentation 
 shall include the circumstances surrounding any suspension, the reason 
 for suspension, and any other pertinent facts concerning the disciplinary 
 action.&#160;&#160;The principal shall file copies of his/her report with 
 the Superintendent, other appropriate personnel and the parent or guardian 
 and retain a copy for his/her records.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon the seizure by any teacher, principal, school security guard, or 
 other school administrator of any firearm, knife, or other dangerous implement 
 which could be used as a weapon or inflict injury, the principal or his 
 or her designee shall be required to report the confiscation to appropriate 
 law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Appeal</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any parent, tutor, or legal guardian of a pupil suspended shall have 
 the right to appeal to the Superintendent or his/her designee, who shall 
 conduct a hearing on the merits.&#160;&#160;If the parent or legal guardian 
 is not present for the hearing after having been properly notified, the 
 hearing may proceed and the results of the hearing shall be mailed to 
 the parent or legal guardian within three (3) school days by certified 
 mail, return receipt requested.&#160;&#160;The decision of the Superintendent 
 on the merits of the case, as well as the term of suspension, shall be 
 final, reserving to the Superintendent the right to remit any portion 
 of the time of suspension.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MANDATORY SUSPENSION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Firearms, Knives, Other Dangerous Instrumentalities, Drugs</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal shall be required to suspend a pupil who:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>is found carrying or possessing a firearm or a knife with a 
	 blade two (2) inches or longer, or another dangerous instrumentality, 
	 except as provided below under the section entitled <i>Suspension 
	 Not Applicable</i>; or<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>possesses, distributes, sells, gives, or loans any controlled 
	 dangerous substance governed by state law, in any form.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Additionally, the principal shall immediately recommend the pupil's 
 expulsion to the Superintendent, for the above offenses, except in the 
 case of a student less than eleven (11) years of age in pre-kindergarten 
 through grade 5 who is found carrying or possessing a knife with a blade 
 two (2) inches or longer, the principal may, but shall not be required 
 to recommend the student's expulsion.&#160;&#160;A student found carrying 
 or possessing a knife with a blade less than two (2) inches in length 
 may be suspended by the school principal, but, in appropriate cases, at 
 a minimum, shall be placed in <i>in-school suspension</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Assault or Battery of School Employees</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever a pupil is formally accused of violating state law or school 
 disciplinary regulations, or both, by committing assault or battery on 
 any school employee, the principal shall suspend the pupil from school 
 immediately and the pupil shall be removed immediately from the school 
 premises without the benefit of required procedures, provided, however, 
 that such procedures shall follow as soon as practicable.&#160;&#160;The 
 student shall not be readmitted to the school to which the employee is 
 assigned until all hearings and appeals associated with the alleged violation 
 have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SUSPENSION NOT APPLICABLE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Suspension of a student shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>A student carrying or possessing a firearm or knife for purposes 
	 of involvement in a school class, course, or school approved co-curricular 
	 or extracurricular activity or any other activity approved by appropriate 
	 school officials.<br>
	<br>
	</p></li>
	<li><p>A student possessing any controlled dangerous substance that 
	 has been obtained directly or due to a valid prescription or order 
	 from a licensed physician.&#160;&#160;However, such student shall 
	 carry evidence of that prescription or physician's order on his/her 
	 person at all times when in possession of any controlled dangerous 
	 substance which shall be subject to verification.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition, school officials, in accordance with statutory provisions, 
 shall have total discretion and shall exercise such discretion in imposing 
 on a pupil any disciplinary actions authorized by state law for possession 
 by a pupil of a firearm or knife on school property when such firearm 
 or knife is stored in a motor vehicle and there is no evidence of the 
 pupil's intent to use the firearm or knife in a criminal manner.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student enrolled in grades prekindergarten through five shall not 
 be suspended from school or suspended from riding on any school bus for 
 a uniform violation that is not tied to willful disregard of school policies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CREDIT FOR SCHOOL WORK MISSED</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who is suspended for ten (10) days or fewer shall be assigned 
 school work missed while he/she is suspended and shall receive either 
 partial or full credit for such work if it is completed satisfactorily 
 and timely as determined by the principal or his/her designee, upon the 
 recommendation of the student’s teacher.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student who is suspended for more than ten (10) days and receives 
 educational services at an alternative school site, shall be assigned 
 work by a certified teacher and shall receive credit for school work if 
 it is completed satisfactorily and timely as determined by the teacher.&#160;&#160;Such 
 work shall be aligned with the curriculum used at the school from which 
 the student is suspended.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>RECUSAL OF ADMINISTRATOR IN DISCIPLINE MATTERS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any school administrator or administrator's designee who is required 
 to make a recommendation, decide an issue, or take action in a matter 
 involving the discipline of a student shall recuse himself/herself whenever 
 a member of the immediate family of the administrator or administrator's 
 designee is involved in any manner in the discipline matter.&#160;&#160;In 
 case of recusal, the action to be taken shall be done so by the Superintendent 
 or an impartial designee of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Immediate family</i> means the individual's children, brothers, sisters, 
 parents, and spouse and the children, brothers, sisters, and parents of 
 the spouse.</p>
