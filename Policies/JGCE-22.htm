<p class="Title">CHILD ABUSE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bienville Parish School Board shall require that instances of suspected child abuse and/or neglect be reported in accordance with appropriate state and local laws and procedures.&#160;&#160;Therefore, the School Board directs that all school personnel be informed of their responsibilities under law as mandatory reporters when performing their occupational duties.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students shall be provided age- and grade-appropriate instruction relative to child assault awareness and prevention, and how students may report abuse or assault to the child protection toll-free hotline operated by the State Department of Children and Family Services, and where students may locate the number for the hotline.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each public school shall post the hotline number in a prominent location on its website.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">DEFINITIONS</font></span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Abuse</i> means any one of the following acts which seriously endanger the physical, mental, or emotional health and safety of the child:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>The infliction, attempted infliction, or, as a result of inadequate supervision, the allowance of the infliction or attempted infliction of physical or mental injury upon the child by a parent or any other person.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exploitation or overwork of a child by a parent or any other person, including but not limited to commercial sexual exploitation of the child.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The involvement of the child in any sexual act with a parent or any other person, or the aiding or toleration by the parent, caretaker or any other person of the child’s involvement in (i) any sexual act with any other person; (ii) pornographic displays; (iii) any sexual activity constituting a crime under Louisiana law; or (iv) a coerced abortion conducted upon a child.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Caretaker</i> means any person legally obligated to provide or secure adequate care for a child, including a parent, tutor, guardian, legal custodian, foster home parent, an employee of a public or private day care center, an operator or employee of a registered family child day care home, or other person providing a residence for the child.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Child</i>, for purposes of this policy, means a person under eighteen (18) years of age, who prior to juvenile proceedings, has not been judicially emancipated or emancipated by marriage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>mandatory reporter</i> means any person who provides or assists in the teaching, training, and supervision of a child, including any public or private teacher, teacher's aide, instructional aide, school principal, school staff member, bus operator, coach, professor, technical or vocational instructor, technical or vocational school staff member, college or university administrator, college or university staff member, social worker, probation officer, foster home parent, group home or other child&#160;care institutional staff member, personnel of residential home facilities, a licensed or unlicensed day care provider, or any individual who provides such services to a child&#160;in a voluntary or professional capacity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>permitted reporter</i> means any other person having cause to believe that a child’s physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Neglect</i> means the refusal or unreasonable failure of a parent or caretaker to supply the&#160;child with necessary food, clothing, shelter, care, treatment, or counseling for any injury, illness, or condition of the child, as a result of which the&#160;child's&#160;physical, mental, or emotional health and safety is substantially threatened or impaired. &#160;Neglect includes prenatal neglect. &#160;In accordance with statutory provisions, the inability of a parent or caretaker to provide for a child due to inadequate financial resources shall not, for that reason alone, be considered neglect. &#160;Whenever, in lieu of medical care, a child&#160;is being provided treatment in accordance with the tenets of a well-recognized religious method of healing which has a reasonable, proven record of success, the&#160;child shall not, for that reason alone, be considered to be neglected or maltreated.&#160;&#160;However, nothing herein shall prohibit the court from ordering medical services for the child when there is substantial risk of harm to the child's health or welfare.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT</font></span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A <i>permitted reporter</i> shall make a report through the designated state child protection reporting hotline phone number or in person at any child welfare office of the state.</p>

<p>A <i>mandatory reporter</i>, <span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">notwithstanding any claim of privileged communication, who has cause to believe that a child's physical or mental health or welfare is endangered as a result of abuse or neglect or that abuse or neglect was a contributing factor in a child's death, in accordance with statutory provisions, shall immediately report suspected abuse/neglect in accordance with the following</font></span> guidelines<span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">:</font></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>When an employee is accused of the use of impermissible corporal punishment or moral offenses involving students, the principal shall initiate an investigation (see procedures under policy <i><a href="GAMC_-_20_final.htm">GAMC, Investigations</a></i>).&#160;&#160;If the offender is a central office employee, or principal, the immediate supervisor will initiate an investigation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">Upon any school employee receiving a report of, or information about, child abuse, against another school employee or volunteer, and the employee receiving said information has cause to believe the truthfulness thereof, the reporting procedure as outlined in this policy shall be followed, depending upon whether the employee or volunteer is considered a caretaker or someone other than a caretaker.</font></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The school employee shall also, as soon as reasonably possible, notify the appropriate immediate supervisor of the accused individual, and that supervisor in turn will as soon as reasonably possible, notify the Superintendent or his/her designee. &#160;The Superintendent and the School Board's attorney will determine what appropriate action the school system may take over and above the investigation being conducted by the appropriate state agency. &#160;In any incident involving an employee or volunteer which is reported to the Superintendent or designee, the person shall be removed from all activities involving direct contact with students until the matter is resolved.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">CONFIDENTIALITY</font></span></u></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><font color="black">Any person who in good faith makes a report, cooperates in any investigation arising as a result of such report, or participates in judicial proceedings authorized under the Louisiana Children's Code shall have immunity from civil or criminal liability that otherwise might be incurred or imposed.&#160;&#160;This immunity, however, does not extend to (1) a person who participates in or conspires with a participant or an accessory to an offense involving the abuse or neglect of a child; (2) any person who makes a report known to be false or with reckless disregard for the truth of the report.</font></span></p>
